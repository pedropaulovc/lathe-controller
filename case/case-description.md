# Lathe Controller Case Description

## Overview
This is a 3D printable enclosure designed to house a custom lathe controller system. The case is specifically sized to fit on a bench lathe while providing easy access to all controls and maintenance areas.

## Physical Dimensions
The case measures 5 inches wide by 3.15 inches deep by 7 inches tall (127mm × 80mm × 180mm). This compact size ensures it won't take up excessive space on your lathe while still providing room for all the electronics and controls inside.

## Case Structure
The case is designed as a single-piece main body with a removable back panel. This design choice makes it much easier to access the electronics inside for wiring, maintenance, or troubleshooting. The main case includes the front panel, left and right sides, bottom, and top all printed as one piece.

## Front Panel Controls
The front face of the case contains all the user controls arranged for easy operation:

- **Digital Display**: At the top center is a rectangular cutout (50mm × 19mm) for the 4-digit LED tachometer display. This shows the spindle RPM in large, easy-to-read numbers.

- **Speed Control**: On the upper right is a round hole (16mm diameter) for the speed control potentiometer. This knob allows you to adjust the motor speed from zero to maximum RPM.

- **Run Button**: On the middle left is a round hole (11.9mm diameter) for the run pushbutton. This is a momentary switch that starts the motor spinning at the speed set by the potentiometer.

- **Jog Button**: On the middle right is another round hole (11.9mm diameter) for the jog pushbutton. This allows you to briefly run the motor at low speed for precise positioning.

- **Emergency Stop**: At the bottom center is a larger round hole (22mm diameter) for the emergency stop mushroom button. This immediately stops all motor operation when pressed.

## Top Cable Entry
The top of the case has a threaded hole sized for NPT 1/2 pipe fittings (21.34mm diameter). This allows you to use a proper cable gland or strain relief fitting to bring the control wires from the VFD into the case. Having the cable entry on top protects the wires from chips and coolant that might be present around the lathe.

## Removable Back Panel
The back of the case is completely open, allowing full access to the interior. A separate flat back panel attaches with four M3 screws located at the corners. This panel keeps the electronics protected while allowing easy removal for wiring or servicing.

## Internal Features
Inside the case, there are several mounting features:

- **Circuit Board Mounts**: Four cylindrical posts positioned to hold the FLORA microcontroller board with M3 screws. These posts keep the board securely mounted and properly spaced from the case walls.

- **Display Mount**: A horizontal shelf near the top front to support the 7-segment display module from behind.

- **Screw Posts**: Four threaded posts at the corners of the back opening. These posts have 2.5mm holes that can be tapped for M3 threads, allowing the back panel to be securely attached with screws.

## Manufacturing Notes
The case is designed to print upright as shown, with no support material required. The wall thickness is 3mm throughout, providing good strength while keeping material usage reasonable. All round holes use high-resolution curves to ensure smooth surfaces for component mounting.

## Assembly Process
To build the controller, you would first 3D print both the main case and back panel. Then install the electronics inside, wire everything according to the provided diagrams, test the system, and finally attach the back panel with four M3 screws. The NPT fitting in the top allows for professional cable management connecting to your VFD.

## Design Benefits
This case design prioritizes practicality and ease of use. The removable back makes initial assembly and future maintenance much simpler. The front-mounted controls are positioned for comfortable operation. The compact size won't interfere with lathe operation while still housing all the necessary electronics. The threaded cable entry provides a professional, sealed connection that will last for years of shop use.
