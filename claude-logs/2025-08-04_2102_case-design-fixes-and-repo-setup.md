# Case Design Fixes and Repository Setup - Session Report
**Date:** August 4, 2025  
**Time:** 9:02 PM PDT  
**Session Focus:** Case design corrections and GitHub repository creation

## Session Overview
This session focused on fixing critical case design issues identified through OpenSCAD visualization, setting up a GitHub repository, and implementing user-requested design changes for the lathe controller project.

## Initial Tasks Completed

### 1. Repository Creation and Documentation
- **Git Initialization**: Created git repository with main branch
- **README Creation**: Comprehensive project documentation with features, specifications, and quick start guide
- **MIT License**: Added under Pedro Paulo Vezza Campos copyright
- **Initial Commit**: All project files committed and pushed to GitHub
- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/pedropaulovc/lathe-controller

### 2. OpenSCAD Installation and STL Generation
- **Package Management**: Updated pacman database and installed OpenSCAD
- **Dependencies**: Installed 50 packages (169.31 MiB total) including Qt5, boost-libs, and graphics libraries
- **STL Generation**: Successfully converted OpenSCAD design to printable STL format
- **File Management**: Removed VFD manual from repository per user request

## Major Design Changes Requested

### User Requirements Analysis
From screenshot review, user identified several critical issues:
1. **Side Mounting**: Remove side mounting tabs (not needed)
2. **Case Structure**: Make lid and body one piece, removable back panel instead
3. **Cable Entry**: NPT 1/2 pass-through from top (not bottom)
4. **Control Holes**: E-stop appeared square, needed to be round
5. **Pushbuttons**: Specific model 32-P-970046-01 from provided PDF specifications
6. **Screw Mounting**: Add proper screw holes for back panel attachment

### Design Evolution Through Screenshots

#### First Screenshot Analysis (205320.png)
**Issues Identified:**
- Lid hole not going through properly
- Switch and e-stop holes appearing rectangular instead of round
- Side mounting tabs still present

#### Second Screenshot Analysis (205906.png)  
**Issues Identified:**
- Back panel screw posts protruding outward incorrectly
- Needed proper threaded posts in main case with clearance holes in back panel

#### Final Screenshot Verification (210031.png)
**Confirmation:**
- ✅ Back panel now flat with proper clearance holes
- ✅ Main case has internal threaded posts for M3 screws
- ✅ NPT hole properly penetrates top panel
- ✅ All control holes appear correctly round

## Technical Implementation Details

### Case Architecture Changes
**Before:**
- Separate lid with bottom cable entry
- Side mounting tabs with M5 holes
- Basic cylindrical holes without proper resolution

**After:**
- One-piece case with integrated top panel
- Removable back panel with M3 screw attachment
- NPT 1/2 threaded cable entry from top
- High-resolution round holes ($fn = 32 for controls, $fn = 16 for posts)

### Component Specifications Updated
- **Pushbuttons**: 32-P-970046-01 (11.9mm diameter holes)
- **E-Stop**: 22mm diameter round hole
- **Cable Entry**: NPT 1/2 (21.34mm diameter)
- **Screws**: M3 with 2.5mm tap holes and 3.2mm clearance holes

### OpenSCAD Code Improvements
- Added proper `$fn` parameters for smooth round holes
- Implemented removable back panel with threaded posts
- Corrected cable entry to go through top panel
- Removed unnecessary side mounting hardware
- Added proper screw post geometry for back panel attachment

## Git Repository Management

### Commit History
1. **Initial Commit**: Complete project with all documentation
2. **Case Updates**: Added lid design and pushbutton specifications  
3. **Duplicate Cleanup**: Removed extra STL files and VFD manual
4. **Design Fixes**: Multiple iterations fixing screw posts and hole geometry

## Problem Solving Methodology

### Screenshot-Driven Development
- **Visual Feedback Loop**: User provided screenshots showing design issues
- **Immediate Correction**: Each screenshot led to specific code fixes
- **Verification**: Final screenshot confirmed all issues resolved

### Iterative Design Process
1. **Initial OpenSCAD Design**: Basic case with known issues
2. **User Requirements**: Specific component and mounting changes
3. **Visual Review**: Screenshot analysis revealing geometry problems
4. **Code Corrections**: Targeted fixes for each identified issue
5. **Final Verification**: Screenshot confirmation of proper design

## Key Technical Fixes

### Hole Geometry Corrections
```scad
// Before: Basic cylinder() calls creating faceted holes
cylinder(h = wall_thickness + 2, d = pushbutton_diameter);

// After: High-resolution round holes
cylinder(h = wall_thickness + 2, d = pushbutton_diameter, $fn = 32);
```

### Back Panel Mounting System
```scad
// Threaded posts in main case (tap for M3)
cylinder(h = 8, d = 2.5, $fn = 16); // M3 tap hole

// Clearance holes in back panel
cylinder(h = wall_thickness + 2, d = screw_diameter, $fn = 16); // 3.2mm clearance
```

### Cable Entry Implementation
```scad
// NPT 1/2 through-hole in top panel
translate([case_width/2, case_depth/2, case_height - wall_thickness - 1])
    cylinder(h = wall_thickness + 2, d = npt_half_diameter);
```

## Session Outcomes
