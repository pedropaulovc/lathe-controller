**Time:** 8:32 PM PDT  
**Status:** Project Complete  
**Duration:** Multi-session development

## Project Overview
Designed and implemented a complete custom controller for a bench lathe powered by a 3/4 HP, 1ph 115V motor with Teco EV Micro Drive VFD. The project evolved from an initial complex design to a simplified, cost-effective solution leveraging the VFD's built-in capabilities.

## User Requirements
- **Primary Function**: Custom controller for bench lathe
- **Motor**: 3/4 HP, 1ph 115V with Teco EV Micro Drive VFD
- **Required Features**:
  1. Adjustable speed control via analog input
  2. Run and jog switches
  3. Emergency stop switch
  4. Tachometer with 7-segment display
- **Physical Constraints**: 5" wide maximum, 8" tall maximum
- **Mounting**: Side-mounted case with front-facing controls
- **Budget**: Cost-conscious design preferred

## Technical Evolution

### Initial Design (Complex)
- Arduino Mega microcontroller
- External 12V power supply with regulation circuits
- Complex analog speed control with op-amp buffering
- Estimated cost: $150-200

### User Feedback & Corrections
1. **Microcontroller**: "FLORA is cheaper" → Changed to Adafruit FLORA
2. **Interrupt Wheel**: "make the interrupt wheel out of metal 1/8 thick to be milled" → Changed from 3D printed to machined brass
3. **Material**: "can i use brass for the interrupt wheel" → Confirmed brass selection
4. **Tooling**: "i have a High-Speed Steel Slitting Saw, 1/8" Thick, 3" Mill Diameter, 30 Teeth only" → Adapted design for slitting saw
5. **Power Supply**: "what is Wall Adapter for" → Led to VFD manual review

### Final Design (Simplified)
- Adafruit FLORA microcontroller (tachometer only)
- No external power supply (VFD provides 24VDC/10VDC internally)
- Direct VFD control for all motor functions
- Brass interrupt wheel with HSS slitting saw slots
- Estimated cost: $90-150

## Key Technical Decisions

### VFD Integration
- **Discovery**: VFD manual revealed internal power supplies eliminate external power needs

## Critical Problem Solving

### Power Supply Elimination
**Problem**: User questioned necessity of 12V wall adapter in BOM  
**Investigation**: Read 2.1MB VFD operating manual  
**Solution**: Discovered VFD provides internal 24VDC and 10VDC supplies  
**Impact**: Eliminated $30-40 in external power components, simplified wiring

### Machining Adaptation
**Problem**: User had specific HSS slitting saw tooling  
**Challenge**: Adapt interrupt wheel design for available tooling  
**Solution**: 60 slots at 6° indexing using 1/8" slitting saw  
**Result**: Optimal slot count for resolution while matching available tooling

## Final Architecture

### Control Flow
1. **Speed**: 10kΩ pot → VFD AI1+ (0-10VDC) → Motor speed
2. **Run**: Momentary switch → VFD DI1 (24VDC) → Forward run
3. **Jog**: Momentary switch → VFD DI3 (24VDC) → Jog forward  
4. **E-Stop**: NC contacts → VFD DI4 (24VDC) → External fault
5. **Tachometer**: Optical switch → FLORA D2 → MAX7219 → 7-segment display

### Power Distribution
- **VFD**: 115VAC line power
- **Switches**: VFD internal 24VDC supply
- **Speed Control**: VFD internal 10VDC supply
- **FLORA**: USB during programming, VFD 24V in operation
